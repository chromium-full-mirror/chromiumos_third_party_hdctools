# Servo Micro

Servo Micro (aka "uServo") is a self contained replacement for Yoshi Servo
Flex. It is meant to be compatible with Servo v2/v3 via [`servod`]. The design
uses [Case Closed Debug][CCD] software on an STM32 microcontroller to provide a
[CCD] interface into systems with a Yoshi debug port.

[TOC]

## Overview

Servo Micro is usually paired with a [Servo v4 Type-A], which provides ethernet,
dut hub, and muxed usb storage.

## Use

Like other Servo boards, the Servo Micro requires [`servod`] to be running:

```bash
(chroot) $ sudo servod -b [board]
```

The Servo Micro connects to the servo header of the DUT in the orientation
where 'dot' indications from the Servo Micro and the servo header align:

Most Servo header functionality should be available, used in the same way as any
other servo. Here you can see the Servo v4 and Servo Micro plugged into a
system.

### Flashing the BIOS or EC with Servo Micro

Servo Micro can be used to flash the AP BIOS or EC with `flashrom`. Note that
`flashrom`'s command line needs to specify the correct endpoint, which is
`raiden` rather than `ftdi`.

For example, on a 3.3V DUT:

```bash
(chroot) $ dut-control spi2_vref:pp3300 spi2_buf_en:on
(chroot) $ sudo flashrom --programmer raiden_debug_spi -r bios.bin
(chroot) $ dut-control spi2_vref:off spi2_buf_en:off
```

*** note
NOTE: There is no `target=(AP|EC)` command as with other `raiden_debug_spi`
devices. Adding this flag to the `flashrom` command will cause an error.
***

## Known Issues

*   JTAG - Servo Micro does not support JTAG.
*   Servo Micro doesn't support `jtag_vref`, or any `_buf_on_flex` controls.
*   If a Servo Micro is plugged into a DUT without being plugged into a host
    machine, it can cause undefined behavior on the DUT.

### Uart Failures

See https://crbug.com/936182.

On Servo micro (and perhaps other STM based Servos (v4)) the UART can become
inoperable and require the USB port to be reset to recover.

This will manifest itself as failures like:

```
Servod - ERROR - Problem initializing SERVO_JTAG_TDI -> off
```

or

```
Problem with ['servo_v4_version'] :: Timeout waiting for response
```

### Overcurrent and Brownouts

See https://crbug.com/1016051.

Some device configurations (verified on cyan boards) are able to draw excessive
current from the Servo Micro, putting the hardware in a non-responsive state.
Brownout detection has been enabled to escape this condition by rebooting the
servos impacted. Impacted DUTs may require deployment using [Servo v2].

## Updating Firmware

Servo Micro can be updated to the latest stable firmware using the
`servo_updater` tool.

*** note
**NOTE**: [`servod`] must not be running when updating since it locks the
device.
***

Sync the latest source:

```bash
(chroot) repo sync
```

Update `sys-firmware/servo-firmware` to the latest version:

```bash
(chroot) ~/trunk/src/scripts/update_chroot
```

Update the firmware:

```bash
(chroot) $ sudo servo_updater -b servo_micro
```

## Developing Servo Micro Firmware

### Compiling

servo micro code lives in the ec codebase. It can be built as follows:

```bash
(chroot) $ cd ~/trunk/src/platform/ec
(chroot) $ make BOARD=servo_micro -j8
```

### Flashing

To flash a working Servo Micro:

```bash
(chroot) $ sudo servo_updater -b servo_micro -f build/servo_micro/ec.bin
```

If the flash is empty or the image is broken, you can flash the Servo Micro
using the `BOOT0` select pin, which is held by USB OTG's ID pin. The easiest way
to do this is to plug a USB OTG adapter into Servo Micro, then plug an A-A cable
into your desktop and Servo Micro.

```bash
(chroot) $ ./util/flash_ec --board=servo_micro
```

## Servo Micro UART

Servo Micro exports a console UART over the small header next to the USM-micro
port. There is a rare cable for this header, but it's easier to just rework UART
wires on and use a standard FTDI pin header 3.3V cable.
