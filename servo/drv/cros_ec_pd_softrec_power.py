"""Power state driver for boards with a PD MCU & edge-sensitive warm reset.

Some chipsets' warm reset appear to be edge-sensitive instead of level
sensitive.  This results in a "one-shot warm reset" when using dut-control to
assert the warm reset line.  That is, the application processor (AP) does reset,
but continues to boot despite the fact that the warm reset line is asserted.
For boards with a PD MCU, this causes a problem with the cros_ec_softrec_power
driver.  That driver assumes that the warm reset is level sensitive for the
system.  If that driver is used with a edge sensitive system, a race occurs
between the AP booting far enough to tell the PD MCU to jump to its RW image and
the command sent to the EC to reboot but keep the AP off.

See crbug.com/606062#c26 for more information.
